#    3. Create and run mutations based on the profile
#
# The "current-contract" directory is populated with the supplied test contract
# and the generated files.

# Since switching to ganache-cli from ethereumjs-testrpc-sc, there are apparently
# lots of zombie instances - kill node for now TODO how to properly fix it?
